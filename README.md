# PPS
Polito Positioning System

Simple script to solve the Least Squares positioning solution on a 2D reference system.

1) Print the MapScan.pdf file, and double check that ticks of the grid are spaced by 1 cm.
2) Put the three pseudolites (pseudo-satellites) in the positiong shown in Picture.jpg, or choose any other pseudolite position you like (remember to change antenna positions in PPS.m).
3) Put the yellow man somewhere in the map.
4) Measure the distance to the three pseudolite.
5) Write the measured distances in the PPS.m file, run it and check you position solution!.
